An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.

Once MILITECH was \\nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\\ntorque. \\n\\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \\nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\\n\\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\\nbottle is $25.\\n\\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\\nmy common sense.\\n\\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?\\nIf you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the \\nsecond floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.\",\n",

As far as I\\ncan tell he doesn\\'t have any particular problem in his mechanics\\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\\nclear that up is playing and practice time.

Olsen  and\\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\\nlearn Tom Glavine\\'s pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn\\'t\\nbe supprised if the pitcher\\'s claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.

Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.

Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...

Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.

       " \"While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  \\nwhen I bought a new truck.\\n\\nI had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  \\nagreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \\nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \\nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \\nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \\nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \\nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \\ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \\nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \\nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \\ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \\ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \\nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \\nthe turn of events.\\n\\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \\nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \\nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \\nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \\nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \\nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \\npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \\nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \\nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\\n\\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \\napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \\nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \\nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \\nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\\n\\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \\ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \\nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \\ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \\nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \\nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\\n\\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \\nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \\nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \\nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \\nmistake.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \\ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \\nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\",\n",

       " 'Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\\nfuel to the flame!\\n\\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\\n\\nrec.autos.driving\\n\\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\\n\\nrec.autos.vw\\n\\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\\na mailing list.\\n\\nrec.audio.car\\n\\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\\nso is mentioned here.\\n\\nrec.autos.antique\\n\\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\\n\\nalt.hotrod\\n\\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\\nperformance vehicles.\\n\\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\\n\\nalso not part of the `official\\' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\\n\\nalt.autos.karting\\n\\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\\n\\nrec.autos\\n\\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\\n\\n\\nCrossposting:\\n\\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\\n\\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\\n\\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\\n\\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\\n\\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn\\'t care less about\\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\\nrec.autos.\\n\\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\\n\\nDistribution:\\n\\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\\n\\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \\nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\\nheaders, and on article content.\\n\\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\\n\\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\\nspread of misinformation.\\n\\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\\n\\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\\nto be supported in your area.\\n\\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\\n\\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\\n\\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\\n\\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\\nquite useless.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Lemons:\\n\\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don\\'t waste everyone\\'s time by\\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x\\' automobile is terrible, so all\\n`brand x\\' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\\nthe `brand x\\' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Flames:\\n\\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\\nof this posting):\\n\\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don\\'t imagine for a\\nminute that including the words `No Flames\\' will work.  It won\\'t, and\\nyou\\'ll get exactly what you deserve.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to flame, you\\'re more likely to get away with it if you can\\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\\nbald, unsupported assertions.\\n\\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\\n\\n\\nAsking the Question:\\n\\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\\nsend email, I don\\'t read this group\\'.  It is a much better idea to\\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\\nI\\'ll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\\nto this request\\'.\\n\\nAnswering the Question:\\n\\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don\\'t tell them to get a Mustang.\\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\\ndefending a speeding ticket, don\\'t tell them to obey the law next time --\\nit\\'s offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn\\'t directly\\naddress the original question.  In general, don\\'t post in order to see\\nyour words in print, and don\\'t post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\\nself-righteous.\\n\\n\\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\\n\\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers\\'; while discussion of\\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\\nof these topics include the following:\\n\\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\\n\\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\\n    radar detectors.\\n\\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\\n\\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car\\' group -- everyone would argue\\n    about what constitutes a `sports car\\'.)\\n\\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver\\'s\\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\\n\\n6)  `Buy American\\' discussions\\n\\n7)  `clever\\' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\\n\\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\\n\\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\\n          Until then, please don\\'t waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\\n\\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com',\n",

If I still wanted the car, I would\\nhave to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the\\nprice if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for \\n6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good\\nexample of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.

Here\\'s a very simele question to which\\nI\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com',\n",

Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\\nthe games he\\'s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\\' career ERA. But\\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your\\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\\n\\n\\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\\n\\nSeriously, Roger, I\\'d really like to hear your explanation of the difference\\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\\nand why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years?\\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\\na run lower than 1992?\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com',\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

       " \"Archive-name: rec-autos/part5\\n\\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\\nmore geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted\\nto misc.consumers.  -- rpw]\\n\\n   [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as\\n    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]\\n\\n                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions\\n\\n\\nTire Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?\\n\\nA:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the\\n    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually\\n    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\",\n",

       " '\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?

       " 'My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  \\nThe outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but \\nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \\ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \\nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \\nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \\nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \\nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \\nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \\ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \\nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \\nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \\nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \\na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\\'s \\nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \\npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \\nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\\n\\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \\ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \\nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \\nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \\nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \\nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \\nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.

Between May 1992 and December 1992 \\nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \\nthat required attention included the transmission, \\nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \\nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \\ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \\nleast four attempts.\\n\\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \\nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \\npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \\nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.',\n",

       " \"Was going over some videos last night.....\\n\\nStudying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very\\ninteresting.  And enlightening.\\n\\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\",\n",

If\\nAmaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes?  He\\'s\\nonly 31, he could have a long career ahead of him!  :-)\\n\\n\\nI think they are a second-division team.

       " \"\\n\\nMy knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can\\ncorrect your statements about our Autobahn:\\n\\n\\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\\nto fear': \\nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\\nhandle it - or you lose... \\nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \\nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\\nand each accident is one accident too much.\\n\\n\\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \\na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\\n\\n\\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\\n\\n\\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\\n\\n\\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\\na bicycle: Your're dead.\\n\\nBye,\\nStefan\\n---\\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\",\n",

Too weird for me.\\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn\\'t have an airbag.  I did look at it\\nfor its RWD virtues but that\\'s it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\\n\\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it\\'s too early to see its\\nreliability so far.  For what it\\'s worth, my comments:\\n\\nMy dislikes:\\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn\\'t drain completely.\\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\\nunderside plastic doesn\\'t like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \\nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C\\'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I\\'m waiting for the day when\\nI bash my head on the corner.\\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \\n\\nMy Likes:\\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the \\'90 SHO I drive)\\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\\nABS/Air bag (see above)\\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\\n\\nAs you can see, I\\'m primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn\\'t\\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \\n\\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn\\'t changed\\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\\nProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \\npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll find\\nthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides\\ndifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\\nthe heat.  I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car so\\nI can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \\nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assume\\nthat you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic\\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\\nbut that\\'s it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\\n\\nLastly, don\\'t store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \\nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\\n\\nNathan\\nnathan@sco.com\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6\\n\\n[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]\\n\\n\\nMany people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite\\nautomotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article\\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\\n\\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\\nprobably not good enough.\\n\\nListserv:\\n\\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\\n\\nThe Alias file:\\n\\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\\n\\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\\n\\n\\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo\\' on that host is\\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\\npossible email list is \\n\\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\\n\\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin\\'s home directory,\\nowned by the list admin.\\n\\nBounced Mail:\\n\\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\\nby the way.

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\\ndifferent story.

Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\\ngame at Shea.

I don\\'t care if there are going to\\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.

I had an alignment problem, but\\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn\\'t have been.\\n\\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\\n\\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\\n\\nEngine \\n4 Alternators\\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\\n2 Water pumps\\n5 thermostats\\nHall effect sensor\\nMain computer\\n4 Batteries\\n\\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\\n\\nRadiator\\nAutomatic Transmission\\nPower Steering\\n\\n\\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it\\'s a good car, I\\njust can\\'t find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\\nworth of repairs over it\\'s lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\\n\\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\\nproduct again, no way.  I don\\'t care how good the LH cars look good, and I\\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.

I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\\n\\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\\n\\nAnd although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, I\\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\\nchrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You\\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.

I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris\\' contribu-\\ntion  from the rest of the team\\'s.  There is only one way of determin-\\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\\nindividual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\n\\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to be rude.\\n\\n\\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\\nindividual\\'s  performance   from that of his team\\'s for the purpose of\\ncomparing that individual\\'s performance with another individual\\'s per-\\nformance.\\n\\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that\\'s  about  it.  There  is  no  new\\nknowledge being produced.

       " \"Archive-name: rec-autos/part4\\n\\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\\nof general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate\\ncrossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]\\n\\n[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,\\n    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]\\n\\n                Commonly Asked Questions\\n\\nRadar Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Where are radar detectors illegal?\\n\\nA:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit\\n    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\\n\\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\\n\\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\\n    is only speculation at this time.\",\n",

       " 'Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.

However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\\nThe Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\\nRogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.

When\\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5',\n",

Not even close.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d put him about there too.  \\n\\nNote: I hadn\\'t realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

       " 'an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to\\n\"sport\" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets\\nthe switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does \"sport\"\\nmode entail?  several things:\\n\\n1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)\\n\\n2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\\'s\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i\\'m sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nOk, here\\'s what I understand:\\n\\nThe SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:\\n\\nHonda Civic\\nToyota Tercel (SL,SL1)\\nToyota Corolla (SL1,SL2)\\nNissan Sentra\\nMazda 323/Protoge\\'\\nSubaru Loyale/Impreza\\nIsuzu Stylus\\nGeo Prizm\\nFord Escort\\nMercury Tracer\\nMistubishi Mirage\\nPlymouth/Dodge Colt\\n\\n\\nTheir core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other\\nmodels are in the same class, but aren\\'t the first cars you would think of.\\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn\\'t include domestic small\\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\\nroots.\\n\\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\\n\\nToyota Paseo\\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\\nMazda MX-3\\nIsuzu Impulse\\nGeo Storm\\nFord Escort GT\\n\\n\\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they\\'re more expensive than they\\'re\\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\\n\\nTercel -> Paseo\\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\\nCivic -> del Sol\\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\\n\\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn\\'t offer the power that some 4-doors\\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let\\'s take another example: the\\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\\nmoney for this type of car.  \\n\\n\\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it\\'s market\\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\\n\\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\\n',\n",
