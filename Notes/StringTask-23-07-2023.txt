In Python, there are several built-in string functions that you can use to manipulate and work with strings. Here are some commonly used string functions and their descriptions:

len(): Returns the length of the string.
str(): Converts a non-string data type to a string.
upper(): Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
lower(): Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
capitalize(): Converts the first character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
title(): Converts the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
count(substring): Returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the string.
find(substring): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in the string, or -1 if not found.
replace(old, new): Returns a new string where all occurrences of 'old' are replaced with 'new'.
split(separator): Splits the string into a list of substrings based on the separator.
join(iterable): Concatenates elements of an iterable (e.g., a list) into a single string using the specified string as the separator.
