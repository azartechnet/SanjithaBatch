Tuples are similar to lists in Python, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Here are some exercises to practice working with tuples in Python:

Create a tuple
Access elements of a tuple
Iterate through a tuple
Concatenate tuples
Tuple unpacking
Find the length of a tuple
Check if an element exists in a tuple
Count occurrences of an element in a tuple
Find the index of an element in a tuple
Convert a tuple to a list
Convert a list back to a tuple
Compare tuples (element-wise)
